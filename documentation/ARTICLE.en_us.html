	Zalando Sans is a bespoke sans serif typeface, developed as a cornerstone of the Zalando brand identity. Designed with flexibility and accessibility at the heart, it meets the diverse needs of the Zalando eco-system.
</p>

<p>
	The typeface offers exceptional adaptability through its variable font technology:
	
	<ul>
		<li>A weight axis ranging from ExtraLight to Black</li>
		<li>A width axis ranging from Condensed to Expanded</li>
		<li>Matching italics</li>
	</ul>
	
	This flexibility allows for a wide range of expressive possibilities while maintaining a cohesive brand presence. Rooted in a sans serif “grotesque” style, the typeface aims to balance clean simplicity with attitude, combining clarity with subtle moments of personality. Its clean lines and modern aesthetic reflect Zalando's forward-thinking approach to fashion and lifestyle.
</p>

<p>
	Staying true to Zalando’s personality—Bold, Fun, and Welcoming—Zalando Sans elevates every design it inhabits. When used effectively, it becomes a powerful design element, showcasing Zalando’s commitment to helping people feel confident in their style.
</p>

<p>
	Zalando Sans was designed by Jakob Ekelund of KH Type, Stockholm in 2025 in collaboration with the Zalando brand and product design teams in Berlin.
